# Countryside
This is the repository holding the source code of Countryside. Countryside is supposed to be an example and test project for the [RoseQuartz game engine](https://devtaube.itch.io/rosequartz). Feel free to look inside this project's source code to see how certain APIs work.

Remember that this is not the only (and defenitely not the best way) to structure a game with RoseQuartz. Pipelines contain multiple nested behaviors that do multiple things at once, and in general everything is a bit messy. I developed the engine while I was making this game, so I didn't even make use of useful APIs, like the `rosequartz.time`- and `rosequartz.math`-packages. There are also some really horrible one-liners in here...

I still hope it's useful for developing with RoseQuartz.
